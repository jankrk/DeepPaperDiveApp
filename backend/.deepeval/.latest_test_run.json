The set of 25 thousand users we randomly sampled among followers of ISIS accounts can be leveraged to perform the prediction of extremist content adoption. We define as a positive instance of adoption in this context when a regular user retweets some content s/he is exposed to that is generated by an ISIS account.\n\nTask III (T3): Predicting interactions with extremists. The third task presents likely the most difficult challenge: predicting whether a regular user will engage into interactions with extremists. A positive instance of interaction is represented by a regular user replying to a contact initiated by an ISIS account.\n\nStatic versus real-time predictions. For each of the three prediction tasks described above, we identified two modalities, namely a static (time independent) and a simulated real-time prediction. In the former scenario, a static prediction ignores temporal dependencies in that the system aggregates all data available across the entire time range (January-June 2015), and then performs training and testing using the 5-fold cross validation strategy by randomly splitting datapoints into the 5 folds and averaging the prediction performance across folds. In the latter scenario, a real-time prediction is simulated in which data are processed for training and testing purposes by respecting the timeline of content availability: for example, the system can exploit the first month of available data (January 2015) for training, and then producing predictions for the remainder 5 months (Feb-Jun 2015), for which performance is tested.\n\nThe performance of our framework in the three tasks, each with the two prediction modalities, is discussed in the following. The section concludes with the analysis of feature predictive power (see \u00a74.4).", "Note that the goal of this work is not to provide new machine learning techniques, but to illustrate that existing methods can provide promising results.

Cross validation.\n\nThe results of our performance evaluation (see \u00a74) are all obtained via k-fold cross validation. We adopt k = 5 folds, and therefore use 80% of data for training, and the remainder 20% for testing purpose, averaging performance scores across the 5 folds. We also use 5-fold cross validation to optimize the parameters of the two learning algorithms (LR and RF), by means of an exhaustive cross-validated grid search on the hyperparameter space.\n\n 3.1.2.

T1B: Simulated real-time detection.\n\nA more complex variant of this prediction task is by taking into account the temporal dimension. Our prior work has demonstrated that accounting for temporal dependencies is very valuable in social media prediction tasks and significantly improves prediction performance [17]: therefore we expect that the performance of our framework in a simulated real-time prediction task will exceed that of the static scenario.", "TABLE 1.

User features include the number of tweets, followers and friends associated to each users, the frequency of adoption of hashtags, mentions, and URLs, and finally some profile descriptors. In total, 18 user metadata and activity features are computed (cf. Table 1).\n\nTiming features: Important insights may be concealed by the temporal dimension of content production and consumption, as illustrated by recent work [14], [15]. A basic timing feature is the average number of tweets posted per day. Other timing features include statistics (average, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) of the intervals between two consecutive events, e.g., two tweets, retweets, or mentions. Our framework generates 14 timing features (cf. Table 1).\n\nNetwork statistics: Twitter content spreads from person to person via retweets and mentions. We expect that the emerging network structure carries important information to characterize different types of communication. Prior work shows that using network features significantly helps prediction tasks like social bot detection [8], [13], [15], and campaign detection [16], [17]. Our framework focuses on two types of networks: (i) retweet, and (ii) mention networks. Users are nodes of such networks, and retweets or mentions are directed links between pairs of users. For each user, our framework computes the distribution of followers and friends of all users who retweet and mention that user, and extracts some descriptive statistics (average, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) of these distributions. Our system builds 20 network statistics features (cf. Table 1).\n\n 3.2.1. Greedy feature selection.\n\nOur framework generates a set F of |F | = 52 features. In our type of prediction tasks, some features exhibit more predictive power than others: temporal dependencies introduce strong correlations among some features, thus some possible redundancy. Among the different existing ways to select the most relevant features for the prediction task at hand [18], in the interest of computational efficiency, we adopted a simple greedy forward feature selection method, as follows: (i) initialize the set of selected features S = \u2205; (ii) for each feature f \u2208 F \u2212 S, consider the union set U = S \u222a f; (iii) train the classifier using the features in U; (iv) test the average performance of the classifier trained on this set; (v) add to S the feature that provides the best performance; (vi) repeat (ii)-(v) as long as a significant performance increase is yield.\n\n 4. Experiments\n\nIn the following, we formalize three different prediction problems related to online extremism:\n\nTask I (T1): Detection of extremist supporters. The first task that our system will face is a binary classification aimed to detect ISIS accounts and separate them from those of regular users. The problem is to test whether any predictive signal is present in the set of features we designed to characterize social media activity related to extremism, and serves as a yardstick for the next two more complex problems.\n\nTask II (T2): Predicting extremist content adoption. The set of 25 thousand users we randomly sampled among followers of ISIS accounts can be leveraged to perform the prediction of extremist content adoption. We define as a positive instance of adoption in this context when a regular user retweets some content s/he is exposed to that is generated by an ISIS account.\n\nTask III (T3): Predicting interactions with extremists.

We extracted over three million tweets related to the activity of these accounts in the period of time between January and June 2015. We also randomly identified an equal-sized set of regular users exposed to the extremist content generated by the ISIS accounts, and collected almost 30 million tweets generated by the regular users in the same period of time.\n\nBy means of state-of-the-art learning models we managed to accomplish predictions in two types of scenarios, a static one that ignores temporal dependencies, and a simulated real-time case in which data are processed for training and testing by respecting the timeline of content availability. The two learning models, and the set of 52 features that we carefully crafted, proved very effective in all of the six combinations of forecasts (three prediction tasks each with two prediction modalities, static and real-time). The best performance in terms of AUC ranges between 72% and 93%, depending on the complexity of the considered task and the amount of training data available to the system.\n\nWe concluded our analysis by investigating the predictive power of different features. We focused on the top 11 most significant features, and we discovered that some of them, such as the ratio of retweets to tweets, the average number of hashtags adopted, the sheer number of tweets, and the average number of retweets generated by each user, systematically rank very high in terms of predictive power.

We exploit a unique dataset containing millions of tweets generated by more than 25 thousand users who have been manually identified, reported, and suspended by Twitter due to their involvement with extremist campaigns. We also leverage millions of tweets generated by a random sample of 25 thousand regular users who were exposed to, or consumed, extremist content. We carry out three forecasting tasks, (i) to detect extremist users, (ii) to estimate whether regular users will adopt extremist content, and finally (iii) to predict whether users will reciprocate contacts initiated by extremists. All forecasting tasks are set up in two scenarios: a post hoc (time independent) prediction task on aggregated data, and a simulated real-time prediction task. The performance of our framework is extremely promising, yielding in the different forecasting scenarios up to 93% AUC for extremist user detection, up to 80% AUC for content adoption prediction, and finally up to 72% AUC for interaction reciprocity forecasting.

We also use around 30 million tweets generated by a random sample of 25 thousand regular users who were exposed to, or consumed, extremist content.\n- For each forecasting task, we design two variants: a post-hoc (time independent) prediction task performed on aggregated data, and a simulated real-time forecast where the learning models are trained as if data were available up to a certain point in time, and the system must generate predictions on the future.\n- We conclude our analysis by studying the predictive power of the different features employed for prediction, to determine their role in the three forecasts.\n\n 1. Introduction\n\nResearchers are devoting increasing attention to the issues related to online extremism, terrorist propaganda and radicalization campaigns. Social media play a central role in these endeavors, as increasing evidence from social science research suggests. For example, a widespread consensus on the relationship between social media usage and the rise of extremist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (viz. ISIS) has emerged among policymakers and security experts. ISIS\u2019 success in increasing its roster to thousands of members has been related in part to a savvy use of social media for propaganda and recruitment purposes. One reason is that, until recently, social media platform like Twitter provided a public venue where single individuals, interest groups, or organizations, were given the ability to carry out extremist discussions and terrorist recruitment, without any form of restrictions, and with the possibility of gathering audiences of potentially millions. Only recently, some mechanisms have been put into place, based on manual reporting, to limit these abusive forms of communications. Based on this evidence, we argue in favor of developing computational tools capable of effectively analyzing massive social data streams, to detect extremist users, to predict who will become involved in interactions with radicalized users, and finally to determine who is likely to consume extremist content.", "4.1. T1: Detection of extremist supporters\n\nIn the following we discuss the static (T1A) and real-time (T1B) scenarios for the first prediction task, namely detecting extremist accounts on Twitter. For example, in the first column, the learning models are trained on data from January 2015, and the prediction are performed and evaluated on future data in the interval February-June 2015.\n\n 4.1.1. T1A: Time-independent detection.\n\nThe detection of extremist user accounts is the most natural task to start the performance evaluation of our framework. Our analysis aims at verifying that the 52 features we carefully hand-crafted indeed carry some predictive signal useful to separate extremist users from regular ones. The dataset at hand contains two roughly equal-sized classes (about 25 thousand instances each), where ISIS accounts are labeled as positive instances, and regular users as negative ones. Each instance is characterized by a 52-dimensional vector, and positive and negative examples are fed to the two learning models (LR and RF). The first task, in short T1A, is agnostic of time dependencies: data are aggregated throughout the entire 6 months period (January-June 2015) and training/testing is performed in a traditional 5-fold cross-validated fashion (cf. \u00a73.1.1).", "4.2.2. T2B: Simulated real-time prediction\n\nWe again consider temporal data dependencies to simulate a real-time prediction for T2. Similarly to T1B, in T2B we preserve the temporal ordering of data, and divide the dataset in training and testing according to month-long temporal slices, as summarized by Table 5. Random Forests again seems to benefit from the temporal correlations in the data, and the prediction performance at peak improves up to 80.2%. Logistic Regression fails again at exploiting temporal information, showing some performance deterioration if compared to T2A. Fig. 2 shows that, for the content adoption prediction, the ranking of the top 11 features in T2B is less stable than that of T1B. The top three most predictive features for this task are (1) ratio of retweets over tweets, (2) number of tweets, and (3) average number of retweets. Note that the latter two top features also appear in the top 3 of the previous task, suggesting an emerging pattern of feature predictive dynamics.\n\n 4.3. T3: Predicting interactions with extremists\n\nOur third and last task, namely the prediction of interactions between regular users and extremists, is discussed in the following, again separately for the static (T3A) and real-time (T3B) scenarios.\n\n 4.3.2. T3B: Simulated real-time prediction\n\nThe final task discussed in this paper is the interaction prediction with temporal data. Given the complexity of this problem, as demonstrated by T3A, we plan to test whether incorporating the temporal dimension will help our models achieve better performance. Table 7 shows that this appears to be the case: Random Forests exhibits an improved temporal prediction performance, boasting up to 72.6% AUC, using the first 5 months of data for training, and the last month for testing."], "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Contextual Relevancy", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.36363636363636365, "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel":
